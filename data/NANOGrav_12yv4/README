OVERVIEW
--------

  This file contains "narrowband" and "wideband" TOAs and timing
solutions for the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, covering data taken
from 2004 to 2017.5 using Arecibo and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT),
with ASP/GASP and PUPPI/GUPPI backend instrumentation. Two papers
(both Alam et al.), covering the narrowband and wideband data sets and
timing, have been submitted to the ApJ Supplement Series for
publication. The narrowband analysis is nearly identical to that of
the 11-year NANOGrav data set, published as "The NANOGrav 11-Year Data
Set: High-precision timing of 45 Millisecond Pulsars" by Arzoumanian
et al. (2018, ApJS, 235, 37; arXiv:1801.01837), but with additional
data quality checks. The wideband timing method is described in
Pennucci, Demorest, & Ransom (2014, ApJ, 790, 93; arXiv:1402.1672),
Pennucci (2015, PhDT), and Pennucci (2019, ApJ, 871, 34;
arXiv:1812.02006).

  This release is available at http://data.nanograv.org.

  All files are ASCII and are formatted for use with standard pulsar
timing packages such as tempo, tempo2, and PINT, except for profile
template files which are FITS format (narrowband) or python pickle files
(wideband).

  The narrowband data set "v2" was previously released to
data.nanograv.org on 2019 Aug 01. The "v3" version was publicly released
to data.nanograv.org on 2020 May 14, simultaneously with the arXiv
posting and submission of the data set papers.  The current "v4" data
set replaces the v3 data set, and we strongly recommend use of v4,
especially for the wideband data set.

  As noted in the change log below, one pulsar (PSR J2317+1439) had a
marginally insignificant timing model parameter (H4) included
erroneously in v3, and needed to have its analysis redone anyway, so
its timing model differs from v3 to v4.  Furthermore, about half of
the pulsars in the wideband data set were affected by a software issue
that corrupted their TOAs at the level of 10s of ns; all of the
pulsars were re-analyzed once this was fixed.

  Questions about the contents of this data set can be sent to David
Nice (niced@lafayette.edu), Megan DeCesar (megan.decesar@nanograv.org),
Tim Pennucci (tim.pennucci@nanograv.org), or Paul Demorest
(pdemores@nrao.edu).

        Directory containing the narrowband data set.

SOFTWARE
--------

  This data set requires up-to-date installations of tempo, tempo2, or PINT.

  For the narrowband data set, if your tempo installation is older than
January 2019 (tempo version 13.000, 2019-01-17, 3452a0c), or of tempo2 is
older than June 2019 (tempo2 version 2019.01.1), it should be updated from
the source repositories at:

   http://tempo.sourceforge.net
   https://bitbucket.org/psrsoft/tempo2

  The latest version of PINT can be obtained from:

   https://github.com/nanograv/PINT

  For the wideband data set, tempo -v should show:
   Tempo v 13.100 (2020-05-14 db5bfa1)
  or later; the latest version is available at the sourceforge link above.

  Please also ensure that the clock files you are using cover the full
range of the data set. Using the provided clock files (see below)
will ensure this.

  All models included here are based on a generalized least squares
(GLS) fit that includes a noise model with covariance between TOAs
(ECORR/jitter parameters, if narrowband; RNAMP/RNIDX red noise parameters,
if significant), as well as "traditional" EQUAD and EFAC parameters.
Additional EFAC parameters for the wideband DM measurements are also included.
All noise model parameters are included in the par files.  In order to run
tempo with GLS fitting, you must include the "-G" flag on the tempo command
line.  Tempo2 will notice the presence of the relevant parameters and enable
GLS fitting automatically.  If this seems not to be working, please check that
your version of tempo/tempo2 is up to date as described above.  In tempo2, if
GLS fitting is working, you should see output lines similar to:

    [t2fit.C:99] NEW fit routine. GlobalFit=false
    [t2fit.C:850] Generated 240 TNepochs from 4 TNECORRs
    (...etc...)




CLOCK FILES
-----------

  The clock files used for our analysis are provided in the clock/
subdirectory.  While the standard files distributed with tempo and
tempo2 should be consistent with the clock files provided in the
current release at the time of writing, this may be a source of
inconsistent results in the future.  Please see
NANOGrav_12yv4/clock/README.clock directory for installation
instructions.




CHANGE LOG
----------
2020/12/18 (TTP)
    Final update for release and publication.
2020/07/25 (TTP)
    Edited this README to reflect differences with v3 version.
    Updated public release (12yv4) available on data.nanograv.org,
accompanying re-submission of the narrowband and wideband data set
papers, which have been accepted to ApJS.  J2317+1439 had one marginally
insignificant timing model parameter removed (H4) in both data sets and
also needed to have its red noise parameters updated.  A complete
re-analyses of the wideband data set also was necessary after a software
issue was discovered shortly after the v3 release, which had corrupted
about half of the pulsars' TOAs at the 10s of ns level.

2020/05/14 (TTP)
    Edited this README to reflect differences with the wideband data set.

2020/05/13 (MED)

    Updated public release (12yv3) available on data.nanograv.org,
accompanying submission of the narrowband and wideband data papers.
    PSR J1022+1001 has been removed from the 12yv3 release due to
persistent and unresolved timing difficulties.

2019/08/01 (MED)

    Initial public release (12yv2) available on data.nanograv.org.
