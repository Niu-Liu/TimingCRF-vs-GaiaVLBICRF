**This is the final version of the IPTA DR2**

The final DR2 version includes two sub-versions.

VersionA: includes full data combination with Keith et al. DM Model
	and white noise (EFACs and EQUADs) parameters copied from 
	previous published PTA and IPTA data releases.

VersionB: includes full data combination with white (EFACs, EQUADs, and 
	ECORRs) and red noise (power-law DM and RED) parameters estimated
	using this combination itself. 


The data are intended to be processed with a recent TEMPO2 version.


Clock correction files that should be used are in the clock/
subdirectory.
